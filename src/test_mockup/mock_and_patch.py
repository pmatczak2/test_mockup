from time import sleep
from unittest.mock import patch
# This imports the sleep function from the time module and the patch decorator from the unittest.mock module.

# pretend I am an external function; I am problematic to test
def calculate():
    sleep(10)
    return "y"
# This defines a function named calculate that sleeps for 10 seconds and then returns the string "y". This function
# is problematic to test because it takes a long time to execute due to the sleep call.
#
#
# I'm developing this; I use external function
def my_function():
    x = calculate()  # <- how to mock calculate() ?
    return x
# This defines a function named my_function that calls the calculate function and returns its result. The calculate
# function is used directly here, so it's not easy to test this function in isolation.

def mytest():
    with patch("__main__.calculate") as calculate_mock:
        calculate_mock.return_value = "blah"
        assert my_function() == "blah"
# This defines a test function named mytest that uses the patch decorator to temporarily replace the calculate
# function with a mock object. The return_value attribute of the mock object is set to "blah", which means that the
# calculate function will return "blah" instead of sleeping for 10 seconds and returning "y". The my_function is then
# called within the assert statement and its result is compared to "blah", which should pass if everything works as
# expected. The patch function is a tool that helps us test code more easily. It's like a magic spell that lets us
# temporarily change how a function works, just for the purposes of our tests. We use patch to create a "fake"
# version of a function, called a "mock", that behaves in a certain way that we decide. In this case, the mytest
# function wants to test the my_function function. However, my_function uses another function called calculate,
# which takes a long time to run because of the sleep(10) call. This makes it hard to test my_function properly. So,
# mytest uses patch to make a fake version of calculate that doesn't actually sleep for 10 seconds, but just returns
# the string "blah" immediately. By doing this, mytest can check that my_function correctly uses the result of
# calculate, without having to wait for 10 seconds every time it runs. Think of it like playing pretend. We're
# pretending that calculate is a different function that behaves the way we want it to, just for the purposes of our
# test. It lets us test our code more easily and quickly, without having to wait a long time for a function to finish
# running.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("start running calculate")
    calculate()
    print("calculate done")

    print("now test calculate")
    mytest()
    print("done")
# This is the main part of the script. It starts by printing a message to indicate that the calculate function is
# being called, then calls the calculate function directly. It then prints a message to indicate that the testing
# phase is starting, and calls the mytest function which performs the test. Finally, it prints a message to indicate
# that the script has finished.
#
# So in summary, this script defines a function calculate which takes a long time to execute, making it hard to test,
# and a function my_function which uses calculate. A test function mytest is defined which uses the patch decorator
# to temporarily replace calculate with a mock object that returns a known value instead of sleeping. This allows
# my_function to be tested more easily. Finally, the script calls calculate and then mytest, and prints messages to
# indicate the progress of the script.
